# hello-world
This is the hello-world tutorial from GitHub

I am an unemployed QA Analyst investigating working on Open Source. I haven't written code in a LONG time but last year I took an awesome Selenium/Java test automation course. Familiar with Java/C# and am going to try a Python tutorial next week. I also just volunteered to help small businesses set up on Shopify sites through Digital Main Street.
